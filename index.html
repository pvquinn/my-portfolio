                <p>Hi, my name is <span class="color-pop">Pillar Quinn</span>, and I am a soon-to-be graduate of Washington State University and Spokane Community College where I am earning my associate's degree in <span class="color-pop">software development</span> and my bachelor's degree in biology. I have a strong passion for software development and am eager to start my career in this field. I am particularly
                    interested in working in Germany, and am willing to do what it takes to secure a work permit in order to make this dream a reality. </p>
                <p>During my time at Spokane Community College, I have gained a wide range of technical skills in full
                    stack web development, <span class="color-pop">Android</span> development, RESTful APIs, and SQL and NoSQL databases. I have also earned several
                    certificates in <span class="color-pop">back end</span> development, mobile
                    development, React, Javascript, front end development, and <span class="color-pop">full stack</span> development, both from college and online from Scrimba. Prior to studying software development, I studied pharmacy for three years and have experience working in pharmaceutical research. </p>
                <p> Outside of my studies, I enjoy riding bikes and singing. I am a focused, thorough, and determined employee
                    who has a proven track record of success, including being named <span class="color-pop">employee of the year</span> at a previous
                    job. I am confident in my <span class="color-pop">problem-solving</span> abilities and am always eager to take on <span class="color-pop">new challenges</span>.
